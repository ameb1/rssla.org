                 Dear prospective RSSer,
                 `,
                 `
                 Congratulations on your acceptance to UCLA as a Regents Scholar, and welcome to UCLA RSS and OSP!
                 We are extremely excited to have you in our OSP, and can't wait to meet you virtually.

                 In these three days, you'll learn what college, UCLA, and RSS are all about — on top of meeting 
                 some lifelong friends and even potentially future roommates! If you have any questions about college, 
                 and I mean any — this is the place to have them answered. We look forward to meeting you soon!
                 `

    WELCOME_BLURB: "Congratulations on receiving the Regents Scholarship! Historically, OSP has stood for our Overnight Stay Program, which takes place over the course of 3-day, 2-night programs at UCLA. In light of current events, we will not be offering this program in person this year - however, we will be offering OSP: Online Socially-distanced Program, coupled with one day of in-person activities. A key aspect of OSP includes Q&A panels for academics and campus life, social activities, and more. In order to get the full OSP experience, we highly recommend you arrange your schedule to let you attend the session from beginning to end. We’re excited to see you!",
